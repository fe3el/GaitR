# GaitR
This repository contains the implementation and analysis of my undergraduate thesis project on **Gait Recognition**, focusing on identifying individuals based on their walking patterns.   The study explores temporal features in gait sequences using **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks, evaluated on **CASIA-B** and **OU-ISIR MVLP** datasets.
